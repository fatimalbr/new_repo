<h1 align="center">The Ultimate SQL Roadmap üíª‚òïÔ∏è </h1>


I'm excited to share how I mastered SQL in just 3 weeks! üî•

Starting from zero knowledge, I quickly learned how to explore, clean, and analyze large datasets. 

Along the way, I discovered hidden patterns, uncovered trends, and identified valuable correlations‚Äîall to transform seemingly boring data into powerful insights.
